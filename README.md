## Hello! I am a Unity Developer

I started learning Unity in March 2021 and began commercial development in February 2022. 
I am particularly interested in game architecture, especially ECS (Entity Component System), and optimization. 
I previously had experience with Java(Android Studio) and C++(Qt) and was involved in competitive programming, but my love for games led me to change my career path.
