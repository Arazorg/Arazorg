## I am a Unity developer who started learning Unity in March 2021 and began commercial development in December 2021. I am particularly interested in game architecture, especially ECS (Entity Component System), and optimization. I previously had experience with Java and C++ and was involved in competitive programming, but my love for games led me to change my career path.
